# RSA scheme implementation (Python)

Implementation of the algorithms defined by the RSA scheme in Python3.
Computes ciphertext from message and Computes message from ciphertext granted access to secret 
decryption key by using Extended Euclidean Algorithm, Unicode Points,
Modular Arithmetic  and [Modular Exponentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_exponentiation)

***Setup***
1. Install `Python` on device if not preinstalled
2. Install primesieve `pip install primesieve`

***What is the RSA Scheme?***
[RSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) is one of the first practical public-key 
cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. In this cryptosystem, the encryption key 
is public and differs from the decryption key which is kept secret. In RSA, this asymmetry is based on 
the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, the factoring problem. 
RSA is made of the initial letters of the surnames of Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman - The minds behind
the RSA Scheme.
